# multi_label_Movie_Genre_Prediction_using_CNN
Multi-Label Image Classification model for Movies Genre prediction using CNN.

Multi-Label Image Classification on Movies Poster using CNN algorithm. Here we try to achieve movie genre classification based only on movie poster images. A deep neural network is designed to jointly describe visual appearance and object information, and classify a given movie poster image into genres. One important thing is that this model was developed on Google Colab, so working this code on Jupyter Notebook will most probably not work, since of the RAM availablity problem.
